# RestoReview 
A RAG-Based Restaurant Review Analyzer
This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to simplify the restaurant selection process by analyzing user reviews. Using Elasticsearch for semantic search and Gemini LLM for advanced analysis, the system recommends restaurants based on user preferences, summarizes reviews, highlights must-try dishes, and identifies key considerations. The application integrates LlamaIndex for LLM orchestration, FastAPI for backend services, Streamlit for the frontend, and is fully containerized with Docker, with automated deployment pipelines via GitHub Actions. This solution transforms complex review data into actionable insights, enhancing user decision-making.
